                    <h3>What Is Solar Energy?</h3>
                    <p>With the sun's rays constantly beaming down upon earth there could be enough energy to satisfy global energy needs for an entire year or more. Technology can be used to harness the sun's energy and make it useable. Free and an inexhaustible resource, solar energy is a great alternative and harnessing it is a relatively new idea. Using solar power as a heat source was the first discovery in harnessing solar energy. The first solar collector was built in 1767 by a Swiss scientist named Horace de Saussure. The second discovery was that electricity could be produced through solar energy.
                    Today solar energy is being seen as an afforadable alternative to gas and electric power. People have begun turning towards natural sources of energy for power with the ever-increasing costs of other power sources.</p>
                    <h3>About Our Solar Bugs....</h3>
                    <p>Our solar bugs can be used for many different purposes; neat gifts, fun toys, or just an easy craft project. However, the informational side to our project provides a glimpse into the world of an alternate power source and can be used as a stepping stone to introduce children to the concept of solar energy. Using an affordable amount of material and a little bit of time, solar bugs can be a great way to bring up the idea of solar power in and outside of the classroom. The materials for our solar bugs can be obtained from your local stores and websites such as Amazon, Ebay, and Radio Shack.</p>
                    <h3>Materials List</h3>
                    <p>-Vibrating motor
                        -Solar panel
                        -Wire(if necessary)
                        -Hot glue gun
                        -Wiggly eyes
                        -Pipe cleaners 
                        -Brown construction paper 
                        -Paper clips</p>
                    <table>
                    <tr><th>Item</th><th>Amount needed</th></tr>
                    <tr><td>Pop Can</td><td>1</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>Wire</td><td>1.2 feet</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>motor</td><td>1</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>small solar panel</td><td>1</td></tr>

                <h3>The Purpose and Long Term 
                <p>Our project puts the idea of solar power being used for electricity and heat on a smaller scale, allowing younger children to make sense of the concept. Our design is a fun and easy way to introduce large classrooms of children to the topic of solar energy while giving them a chance to express creative freedom and pick up the thought of recycling. Our project will soon be involved further in our community through the children at our local elementary school. We hope to obtain a grant through our high school Pride organization that will allow us to produce enough materials to supply an entire classroom. With this we will take time to teach a lesson about solar energy at the school and allow the students to produce their own solar bugs. This will give the community's children a chance to learn about solar energy and how to put it to use.</p>
